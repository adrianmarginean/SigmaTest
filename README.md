## Installation

To get started with SigmaTest, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/adrianmarginean/SigmaTest.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```sh
    cd SigmaTest
    ```

3. Restore the dependencies:
    ```sh
    dotnet restore
    ```

4. Update the database connection string in `appsettings.json`:
    ```json
    "ConnectionStrings": {
      "DefaultConnection": "Server=(localdb)\\mssqllocaldb;Database=SigmaTestDB;Trusted_Connection=True;MultipleActiveResultSets=true"
    }
    ```

## Usage

1. Run the application:
    ```sh
    dotnet run
    ```

2. Open your browser and navigate to `https://localhost:5001/swagger` to explore the API endpoints using Swagger UI.

## API Endpoints

The following API endpoints are available:

- `POST /api/Candidates/UpsertCandidate`: Upsert candidate.


## Database Migration

To apply the latest database migrations, use the following commands:

1. Add a new migration:
    ```sh
    dotnet ef migrations add InitialCreate
    ```

2. Update the database:
    ```sh
    dotnet ef database update
    ```

## Code Improvements

1. **Use DTOs (Data Transfer Objects):**
   - Implement DTOs for data transfer between the client and server to decouple the data model from the API.
   - This helps in maintaining a clean separation of concerns.

2. **Implement Repository and Unit of Work Patterns:**
   - Introduce repository and unit of work patterns to manage data access more effectively and maintain clean code architecture.

3. **Add Logging:**
   - Integrate a logging framework like Serilog or NLog to capture and store application logs.
   - This will help in diagnosing issues and monitoring application behavior.

4. **Error Handling Middleware:**
   - Implement custom error handling middleware to manage exceptions globally and return standardized error responses.

## Database Improvements

1. **Database Indexing:**
   - Analyze the database queries and add indexes to frequently queried columns to improve performance.

2. **Data Validation:**
   - Add data validation constraints at the database level to ensure data integrity.

3. **Normalization:**
   - Review the database schema and normalize it to reduce data redundancy and improve data integrity.

## Documentation Improvements

1. **Detailed API Documentation:**
   - Enhance the Swagger documentation with detailed descriptions, examples, and response types for each endpoint.

2. **Inline Comments:**
   - Add inline comments to the codebase to explain complex logic and improve code readability.


## Testing Improvements

1. **Unit Tests:**
   - Increase the coverage of unit tests to ensure that all critical components are tested.
   - Use a framework like xUnit or NUnit for writing tests.

2. **Integration Tests:**
   - Implement integration tests to verify the interaction between different components and external systems.

3. **Automated Testing:**
   - Set up automated testing in the CI/CD pipeline to run tests on each code commit and deployment.

## Security Improvements

1. **Authentication and Authorization:**
   - Implement role-based access control (RBAC) to restrict access to specific endpoints based on user roles.

2. **Data Encryption:**
   - Ensure sensitive data is encrypted both in transit and at rest to protect it from unauthorized access.

3. **Input Validation:**
   - Validate all user inputs to prevent SQL injection, XSS, and other common vulnerabilities.



## Conclusion

Implementing these improvements will enhance the overall quality of the SigmaTest project, making it more robust, maintainable, and user-friendly. Regularly reviewing and updating these suggestions as the project evolves will ensure continuous improvement.
